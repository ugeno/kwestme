        <p>
            When you were little you were always told not to go to the "Forbidden Cave" because there were monsters and dangers.<br/> 
            You weren't told exactly were this cave was but you were also told not to go past the tree line on the far horizon of the village,<br/>
            so you thought that was were the cave was.<br/>
            Past the horizon...
        </p>
        <p>
            12 years later.<br/>
            Wondering through the town you look out at the horizon and ponder about what lies past it, you decided you shall go explore it.<br/>
            Alone with no-one the bother you, so you go home and gather suplies; clothes, food, a homemade sling-shot and the dagger you got for your 16th birthday.<br/>
            You saddled your horse and rode towards the tree line, carefree with your only thoughts being to get past the trees.<br>
            You get there and their are two paths but on both of them their is a rotting, mossy wooden sign saying,<br/> 
            'DANGER! DO NOT ENTER'<br/> 
            but this was what everyone had always told you you looked at both the paths. Both leading deep into the woods. Both leading deep into the dark.<br/>
            Both leading to the forbidden cave...
