            You go down the path, carefully following its twists and turns, it's sharp corners and long turns.<br/>
            You are glad that you chose this path as the light is a massive ally.<br/>
            You keep on walking, but you stop as you see a deep ravine. There is a narrow rickety bridge that you could cross on,<br/>
            but it seems old and might break if you step on it. In the distance you see that there is a safer part of the ravine;<br/>
            a less steep slope on both sides.
