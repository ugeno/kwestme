        There are two paths ahead of you both leading into the woods. <br/>
       The left one goes straight and doesn't turn or twist in any direction, but it has very little light. <br/>
       On the other hand, the one on the right is wild leading in all direction; left and right, winding past trees, there is alot of light shining onto this path.<br/>
       Which path do you take?
