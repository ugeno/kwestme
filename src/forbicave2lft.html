            You start walking down the path, the deeper in you go the less you can see and the more you get scared and nervous.<br/>
            You start to wonder if you should have gone the other way. But when you turn around you see the forset has closed behind you and is shrinking back towards you.<br/>
            You break into a run. You suddenly come to a halt as you realise there is a steep and deep ravine infront of you roughly about 5 meteres wide.<br/>
            You have two choices and jump over the ravine then <a href="forbicave3end.html">Click Here</a>
            If you try to run around it then <a href="forbicave3sur.html">Click Here</a>
